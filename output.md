By Nick Hornby

**Chapter 1: First Encounter**

My love affair with football started like many great romances: suddenly, unexpectedly, and without any warning. In the spring of 1968, my uncle took me to Highbury for my first Arsenal game against Stoke. I don't remember a thing about the match itself, but the sheer presence of the stadium is burned into my memory.

**Chapter 2: The Addiction Begins**

That day, my obsession took root. It wasn't just about the game itself; it was the whole experience. The walk to the stadium, the crisp programme in my hands, the warm Bovril on a cold day, the roar of the songs. It was a world I could belong to. I might not have had a girlfriend, or any special skills, but I could belt out 'One-Nil to the Arsenal' with every ounce of my being.

**Chapter 3: Seasons of Highs and Lows**

Seasons blurred into a rollercoaster of hope and heartbreak, of unforgettable wins and devastating losses. Arsenal was the one constant in my life, a dependable provider of both incredible highs and crushing lows. While other kids collected stamps, I collected Arsenal memories. Each moment held its own special significance, carefully filed away in my mind.

**Chapter 4: More Than Just a Game**

It was far more than just a game; it was a family, a shared sense of who we were. In the stands at Highbury, I discovered a feeling of belonging that was missing from the rest of my life. We were bound together by our passion for the team, our hopes and dreams rising and falling with every game, every goal, every incredible save.

**Chapter 5: A Lasting Passion**

The years have flown by, but the fire still burns. Arsenal remains a part of who I am, woven into the very core of my being. The victories might not feel quite as ecstatic, the defeats not as devastating, but the love endures, a constant and comforting presence throughout the ups and downs of life.
